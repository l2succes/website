I spent over 16 months traveling around the world while working at Artsy. This is me documenting the challenges, pros vs. cons of working remotely for many months.

## 1st Month: Bali

I joined this program called [The Remote Experience](http://theremoteexperience.com) which is essentially a company that solely focused on putting on trips for people tired of working in an office space and have the flexibility to work from anywhere.
