This blog post is part of a series that I'm starting about how to leverage AI to build a startup.

## My Journey with AI Coding Tools

I've started using the different AI tools specifically around coding because I'm an engineer. And I started with VS Code autocomplete at the time. Then I started using Cursor when the Cursor wave started. And I've essentially solely moved all my apps to use Claude Code.

## Why Claude Code Changed Everything

Claude Code has been amazing. I was very skeptical at first. I actually remember when my friend David told me about it. I was like, okay, that looks good, but I don't need to go back to the terminal right now.

After giving it some work, after trying it for a while, I realized that Claude Code was really game changing. It was nothing like it in the market.

## Beyond Just Coding

Because really, especially for a busy fintech founder like myself, there's so many things that you need to handle during the day from compliance to legal and all these things.

So actually, my co-founder and I started thinking: maybe we can put the entire business in GitHub and use Claude Code to organize our thoughts. But not just organize our thoughtsâ€”create new artifacts for the business. Anything from growth, marketing, product.

## What's Next

In this series, I'll be sharing how we're using AI tools to build Blaze with a lean team, and the specific workflows that have made the biggest difference.
