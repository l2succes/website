excerpt: "Reflecting on two years of building Blaze - from bootstrapping to securing Stellar grants, navigating fintech regulations, and learning what it takes to launch a global payment platform."

I've now been working on Blaze for about two years and I just want to take a step back and think through all the things that we faced while building it.

## The Beginning: Bootstrapped and Determined

We started working on this bootstrapped. We basically funded the development of the app with our own funds until we applied for a Stellar grant and got a Stellar grant that enabled us to really focus on the project.

## Choosing Stellar

We were excited because Stellar, you know, we looked at a bunch of different blockchains and Stellar ended up being the best blockchain for us on that platform at the time. And so we did a bunch of work on making the app and integrating APIs, looking at different providers and learned a lot along the way about how hard it can be to launch a fintech.

## The Regulatory Journey

One, you need some licenses sometimes to work with partners. So we went out and got licenses. We did a bunch of learning about where we should get licenses in order to launch a global Venmo.

Some of the things we've done there were to acquire a VASP in Europe and we got MSB licenses in the US and that enabled us to work with some partners including Bridge.xyz which turned out to be a good decision because it's a really successful startup in the stablecoin space.
